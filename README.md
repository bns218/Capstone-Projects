## 1 Fifa20
* FIFA 20 Football is arguably the most popular sport in the world and FIFA is the most popular football (soccer) simulation game by Electronic Arts (EA Sports).
The dataset provided includes the players data for the Career Mode from FIFA 15 to FIFA 20 ("players_20.csv"). The data allows multiple comparisons of the same players across the last 6 versions of the videogame.

### Problem Statement

Task 1:-Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given data.  

Task 2:- Explore football skills and cluster football players based on their attributes.  

Task3:- Explore the data and attempt all the below asked questions in a
step by step manner:  

     ● Prepare a rank ordered list of top 10 countries with most players. Which countries are producing the most footballers that play at this level?  
     ● Plot the distribution of overall rating vs. age of players. Interpret what is the age after which a player stops improving?  
     ● Which type of offensive players tends to get paid the most: the striker, the right-winger, or the left-winger?   

## 2 Flight Price Predicition
* Flight ticket prices can be something hard to guess, today we might see a price, check out the price of the same flight tomorrow, it will be a different story. We might have often heard travelers saying that flight ticket prices are so unpredictable. That’s why we will try to use machine learning to solve this problem. This can help airlines by predicting what prices they can maintain. 

### Problem Statement
Task 1:-Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given data.  

Task 2:-Create a predictive model which will help the customers to predict future flight prices and plan their journey accordingly.

## 3 Heart Disease Predicition
* Heart disease is the number one cause of death worldwide, so if you're looking to use data science for good you've come to the right place. To learn how to prevent heart disease we must first learn to reliably detect it.  
* Our dataset is from a study of heart disease that has been open to the public for many years. The study collects various measurements on patient health and cardiovascular statistics, and of course makes patient identities anonymous.  
* Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Four out of 5CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one-third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 11 features that can be used to predict a possible heart disease.  
* People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.  

### Problem Statement

Task 1:-Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given data.  

Task 2:- Create a model predicting potential Heart Diseases in people using Machine Learning algorithms.  

Task3:-Suggestions to the Hospital  to awake the predictions of heart diseases  prevent life threats.  

## 4 Rice Leaf Disease

This dataset contains 120 jpg images of disease-infected rice leaves. The images are grouped into 3 classes based on the type of disease. There are 40 images in each class.  
Classes  
*	Leaf smut
*	Brown spot
*	Bacterial leaf blight

### Problem Statement
Task 1:-Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given data.

Task 2:-Create a model which can classify the three major attacking diseases of rice plants like leaf blast, bacterial blight and brown spot.

Task3:- Analyze various techniques like Data Augmentation, etc and create a report on that.
